README file for AlgonautsProject2021 folder in the BOLD Moments Dataset.

The folder contents contain the challenge submission reports of the top three winners and an encoding model procedure on the BMD dataset, as performed for 
The Algonauts Project 2021: How the Human Brain Makes Sense of a World in Motion. We 
provide code and detailed instructions for an encoding model procedure through both an 
interactive notebook and an Anaconda environment (github). Note that the code and ROIs 
presented here are not necessarily the same code and ROIs used in the BMD manuscript.
