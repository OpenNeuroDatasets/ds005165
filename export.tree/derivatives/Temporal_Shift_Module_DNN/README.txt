README file for the Temporal_Shift_Module_DNN in the BOLD Moments Dataset.

This folder provides the code, pretrained weights, and instructions to run the 
video-computable Temporal Shift Module Deep Neural Network. We additionally 
provide the extracted features at each 
block of the network from each of the 1102 BMD video stimuli. PCA results are located
in ./BOLDMoments/analysis/encoding_hierarchy/pca/
